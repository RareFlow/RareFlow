> **TL;DR**: RareFlow is a physics-aware, dual-conditioned flow-matching framework for cross-sensor super-resolution (SR) of rare geomorphic features.  
---

## üóûÔ∏è News
- **TBA** ‚Äî public release of code & weights after paper acceptance. Watch ‚≠ê the repo to get notified.

---

## ‚≠ê Highlights
- **Dual-conditioning with gated ControlNet** to balance LR structure vs. semantic priors.
- **Physics-aware objective:** FFT-magnitude alignment + CIELAB radiometric consistency + LPIPS.
- **Uncertainty-aware control:** MC-dropout drives per-block gates to reduce prior ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù on OOD inputs.
- **Unified SR + harmonization:** Cross-sensor style transfer while preserving geometry.
- **Benchmark results:** Strong perceptual quality (e.g., ~40% FID reduction) with competitive fidelity. <!-- TODO: Confirm/adjust numbers -->

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Datasets & Task

- **Input:** 10 m Sentinel-2 RGB tiles (12-bit ‚Üí normalized).  
- **Target:** 2 m Maxar RGB tiles; cross-sensor and cross-temporal pairs with small spatial/temporal misalignments.  
- **Focus:** Rare geomorphic features (e.g., **retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS)**) in Arctic regions.  
- **Notes:** Strong domain shift, small crop sizes, non-standard dynamic range.

> We will release pre-processing & normalization utilities (percentile and fixed-range) and pairing scripts **upon acceptance**.
